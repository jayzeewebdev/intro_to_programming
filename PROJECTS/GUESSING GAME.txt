This program is a small number‑guessing game. The secret number is always 7, and the player must keep guessing until they get it right. Here’s how it works:
• 	The program starts by setting the secret number to 7 and creating a counter to track how many guesses the player makes.
• 	It asks the player for their first guess and counts it as an attempt.
• 	Then it enters a loop that keeps running as long as the guess is not equal to 7.
• 	If the guess is too low, it shows “Incorrect, too low”.
• 	If the guess is too high, it shows “Incorrect, too high”.
• 	After each wrong guess, it asks the player to guess again and increases the attempt counter.
• 	When the player finally guesses 7, the loop stops.
• 	The program then displays a message saying the guess was correct and tells the player how many attempts they made.
